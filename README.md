This code was made just for fun in one sitting as a challenge to invent and create a "new" game in one night. 

I am aware of the fact i could have used variables instead of .txt files to store data but this was good testing ground for other project i am working on so i went with it, if you want you can freely edit all the code to be stored in variables instead.

P.s I know the code is pretty messy but still learning...
