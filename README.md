This code was made just for fun in one sitting as a challenge to invent and create a "new" game in one night. 

I am aware of the fact i could have used variables instead of .txt files to store data but this was good testing ground for other project i am working on so i went with it, if you want you can freely edit all the code to be stored in variables instead.

EDIT: diceroll2.bat is made using only variables, it was fun to challenge myself to create that version as well since i had the bones of the project already...




P.s I know the code is pretty messy but i am still learning...
